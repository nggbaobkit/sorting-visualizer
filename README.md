# Sorting Visualization

I wanted to understand sorting algorithms better and practicing ReactJS, HTML, SASS, so I created this project. Hope you guys like it as much as I do.

The application is deployed [here](http://nggbaobkit.github.io/sorting-visualizer). Feel free to pay a vist!

$ npm start

## To merge all dependabot PRs into one PR

On GitHub, click the 'Actions' tab at the top of your repository, then under 'All workflows' on the left click 'Combine PRs', and finally on the righthand side, click 'Run workflow'.
Note: You might need to set `Only combine PRs that are green (status is success)` to false (idk why).
